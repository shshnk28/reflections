When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when ever there is a need to share our work woth collegues

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so as to get rid of unnecessary automatic pulls done by git. we need to do so ongly if there is a need for  a pull
